# Master Degree Final Project
Final project for the master degree exam, university of Genoa, academic year 2022/2023.

## AgentSpeak & Jason Examples
If you are not proficient about the use of Jason and AgentSpeak, this directory contains some simple and useful examples to understand how it work, together with the instructions for running them

## BDI only
First version of the project, includes only BDI agents.

This project was developed for the first preliminary testings and conclusions.

## RL sandbox
Training project for the RL agents.

Since RL agents need to be trained before play with BDI agents, this project was developed to make them play in a sandbox environment in order to have them learn a game completion policy.

## BDI + RL
Final version of the project, includes both the BDI agents of the first project and the RL agents of the second project.

Here BDI and pre-trained RL agents can play together.

##
All of the projects were developed using the Jedit IDE (version 4.2), the Jason Java library (version 3.1) and the AgentSpeak language.

Extra added libraries: YamlBeans Java library.
